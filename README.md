This repository features a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on ultramarathon race statistics. Utilizing a dataset with over 7 million entries from Kaggle, this project delves into performance trends, demographic influences, and seasonal impacts on race outcomes. The analysis employs advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques using Pythonâ€™s Pandas and Seaborn libraries within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset, "The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running," contains detailed records dating back to 1798, including race distances, locations, and extensive athlete demographics and performance metrics.

Access the dataset used in this project here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: Programming language used.
- Pandas: For efficient data manipulation.
- Seaborn: For generating informative visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running and documenting the analysis.

## Project Structure
- Ultra_Marathon_EDA.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization steps.

## Key Insights
# Performance Trends
- Historical data reveals a general improvement in race times, likely reflecting advancements in training methods and race logistics.
- Performance variability is more pronounced in longer races (e.g., 50 miles) compared to shorter ones (e.g., 50K), suggesting that increased distances introduce additional complexities affecting athlete outcomes.
# Seasonal Impact
- Race times are generally faster in cooler weather, with spring races displaying average speeds about 1 km/h faster than those in summer.
- Winter conditions, while potentially harsh, often lead to faster race times due to reduced risk of overheating, though extreme cold can also pose challenges.
# Demographic Patterns
- Male athletes frequently show faster speeds than their female counterparts.
- Younger athletes tend to have quicker speeds, but older athletes demonstrate considerable consistency, highlighting the role of experience in endurance races.

## Visualization Highlights
- Histograms and violin plots help visualize the distribution and variance of race lengths and speeds by season and gender.
- Scatter plots explore the correlation between athlete age and speed, showing younger runners typically perform better.

## Future Directions
Potential areas for further research include:
- Investigating the effects of nationality and specific training programs on performance.
- Predictive modeling to forecast outcomes based on trends identified in the dataset.
- Comparative studies between ultramarathon performances and those in marathons or other endurance events.
